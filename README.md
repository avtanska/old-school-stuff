old-school-stuff
================

Old school projects from the University of Helsinki years. It is a nice trip down memory lane when going through old code from ten years back. Even nicer to still understand the code after all these years!

Most of the projects are in Finnish and all files and documentation is in original shape, cope with it. :)
